# Brute_Force_Search
Consider right triangles with sides a, b and c that are all positive integers sides where the sum of the squares of two sides equals the square of the third side, i.e.,  


Write a script that

- Inputs start and stop

- Finds and outputs all such right triangles with sides falling in the range [start, stop]

It Uses a "brute-force" approach, i.e., an approach with a triple-nested for-loop that tries all possibilities. Avoid duplicates, i.e., output 3 4 5 only but not 4 3 5.
